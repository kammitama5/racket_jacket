- These are notes and exercises worked through via pair-programming (or by myself)
  for the week of [Racket Summer School](https://summer-school.racket-lang.org/2018/plan/index.html).
  The theme was "Make your own language" (so parsers, lexers, grammars, type-checking, domain-specific
  languages)
